  <section class="post-content"><p>Often as climaxes in the plot, three dozen surgical scenes with remarkable reality are featured in the 20 episodes of <em>The Knick</em>. Together they form the intellectual and technical skeleton of the storyline, and provide indispensable sources of dramatic tension.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the major operations with brief descriptions. Enclosed in the brackets are the participating surgeons, the first of whom leads the procedure. 
Chickering, by default, refers to Dr. Bertram “Bertie” Chickering, Jr.; 
Harriet is the Catholic religious name of Rose Agnes Dolan.
<br /><br /></p>

<hr />
<p><br />
<strong>01  CESAREAN SECTION</strong>  [01] <br />

<p><strong>02  INTESTINE RESECTION</strong>  [01] <br />

  (Thackery, Gallinger, Chickering, and Edwards)
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>03  UNDEDUCIBLE</strong>  [02]  <br />

<p><strong>05  INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR</strong>  [03] <br />
  In his underground operating room, Edwards invents a three-layer hernia procedure and performs it on Mr. Cockrell. The repair is successful, but the patient dies later as he ignores the postoperative instruction of refraining from strenuous activity. <br />
  (Edwards) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>08  FILI-GALVANOPUNCTURE OF ANEURYSMS</strong>  [04] <br />
  The doctors save Mr. Gatchell from his aortic aneurysm following a gavanic procedure that combines wire insertion and electrothrombosis. Edwards coauthors the original paper. <br />

<p><strong>12  CESAREAN SECTION</strong>  [05] <br />
  During her labor, Mrs. Lefkowitz is diagnosed with an extreme case of <em>placenta previa</em>. A C-section is performed in 72 seconds, but fails again. <br />
  (Thackery and Chickering) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>13  BLOODLETTING</strong>   [06] <br />
  Almost in a state of desperation, Gallinger performs <em>venesection</em> (or <em>phlebotomy</em>) on his own daughter Lillian to save her from <em>meningitis</em>. This despairing effort results in failure.<br />
  (Gallinger and Harriet) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>14  CESAREAN SECTION</strong>  [06]  <br />

<p><strong>18  TRAUMA SURGERIES</strong>  [07]  <br />

  (Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, Chickering, Harriet, and Williams) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>19  CERVICOFACIAL ACTINOMYCOSIS SURGERY</strong>  [08]  <br />
  While removing the abscess from the patient’s mental foramen, Thackery cannot finish the procedure due to his cocaine withdrawl. Edwards takes over the scalpel. <br />
  (Thackery, Edwards, and Gallinger) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>20  BRAIN TUMOR SURGERY</strong>  [10]  <br />
  Before dealing with the tumor, Thackery relieves the patient’s intracranial pressure through <em>cranial trephination</em>. The hole is left open after the operation. <br />
  (Thackery, Edwards, and Chickering) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>21  SPLENECTOMY</strong>  [10]  <br />
  Zinberg operates on a <em>splenic anemia</em> patient by surgically removing his spleen. <br />
  (Zinberg) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>22  BLOOD TRANSFUSION</strong>  [10] <br />
  Thackery transfuses his own blood to the young Sonya Smyslov suffering from <em>anemia</em> caused by <em>chlorosis</em>. The girl is killed as a result of Thackery’s erroneous understanding of human blood types.<br /> 
  (Thackery) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>23  CESAREAN SECTION</strong>  [11] <br />
  Elkins assisted in a placenta previa surgery while Thackery is being “treated” at the Cromartie Hospital and Gallinger has not returned from his suspension. The procedure has become a routine at the Knick. <br />
  (Edwards and Chickering) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>24  RHINOPLASTY</strong>  [11] <br />
  Thackery performs a cosmetic surgery on a female Cromartie patient using her “golden” earring as an insert. <br />
  (Thackery) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>25  CHOLECYSTECTOMY</strong>  [11] <br />
  During the operation, Edwards supervises Chickering to separate and ligate the two <em>cystic arteries</em> within the patient’s <em>cystohepatic triangle</em>, or <em>Calot’s triangle</em>. <br />
  (Chickering and Edwards)  <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>26  TUBERCULAR OSTEOMYELITIS SURGERY</strong>  [11] <br />
  Chickering leads the procedure and dissects the abscess down to the bone to release the pus. Meanwhile, Mays shows incompetence of the surgical technique.<br />
  (Chickering and Mays) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>27  RETINAL DETACHMENT REPAIR</strong>  [12] <br />
  The previous fight left Edwards’ retina almost separated from the rear wall of his left eye. An incision on the sclera is intended to release the subretinal fluid and thus have the retina in contact with the <em>choroid</em>. The operation, however, is terminated at its beginning due to Thackery’s drug withdral and hallucinations.<br />
  (Thackery) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>28  HEPATIC CANCER SURGERY</strong>   [13] <br />
  The doctors attempt to remove a tumor on the inferior surface of the patient’s liver. Edwards instructs Gallinger to bisect the healthy liver tissue leading to the tumor and tie off all blood vessles contained within.<br />
  (Gallinger and Edwards) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>29  TRACHEOTOMY</strong>  [14] <br />
  While cauterizing the incision, Mays ignites the flammable ether and is killed by the fire. <br />
  (Mays) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>30  PYROTHERAPY OF NEUROSYPHILIS</strong>  [14] <br />
  (Not a surgery)  Thackery elevates Abigail’s body temperature to 106 degrees Fahrenheit through the injection of malaria parasites. A higher therapeutic fever induced in a hypertherm cabinet effectively kills the <em>syphilis spirochetes</em> (<em>Treponema pallidum</em>). Her malaria is subsequently cured by <em>quinine</em>.<br />
  (Thackery and Edwards) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>31  TOPECTOMY</strong>  [15] <br />
  Experimenting on Mr. Sidney Carton, who loses the top of his cranium but retains an intact brain, Thackery elicits the motional and emotional responses of the patient by stimulating selected points of his brain with electric currents. Furthermore, using a rheoscope, Thackery identifies a brain spot excited after injecting the patient with a dose of morphine. In a subsequent operation, Thackery surgically removes the “morphine region,” but leaves Carton in a vegetative state.<br />
  (Thackery) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>32  TRAUMA SURGERIES</strong>  [15] <br />
  The staff of the Knick treat 124 injurers from the construction accident of the New York City subway system, in which six people die and 150 wounded.<br />
  (Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>33  ESOPHAGEAL CANCER SURGERY</strong>  [16] <br />
  Several experimental methods are employed to treat the esophageal tumor of Anne Chickering, Bertie’s mother. After trying <em>Röntgenotherapy</em>, Bertie and Edwards attempt an ionic surgery by passing electric currents through mercury-coated zinc needles inserted into the tumor. After confirming its inefficacy, Bertie decides on the highly risky <em>laryngectomy</em>, which fails not unexpectedly due to the complex attachment of the tumor with the laryngeal, tracheal, and esophageal tissues.<br />
  (Chickering, Edwards, and Zinberg) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>34  SEPARATION OF OMPHALOPAGUS TWINS</strong>  [17] <br />
  Through X-ray examination, Thackery concludes that the only vital organ that Zoya and Nika—a pair of Minsk-borned twins conjoined by a band of cartilage and soft tissue in their midsection—share is their liver. After devising a procedure to bisect the liver with little hemorrhaging, the surgical team, including four doctors and six nurses, separate the twins after a three-and-a-half-hour battle. The entire operation is filmed by a motion picture camera.<br />
  (Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>35  UMBILICAL HERNIA REPAIR</strong>  [17] <br />
  Mr. Garrison Carr is paralyzed on the operating table after Edwards injects his muscles attached to the aponeurotic membrane with a <em>curare</em> solution secretly distilled by Gallinger, who then saves Carr in the emergency by a tracheotomy. <br />
  (Edwards and Gallinger) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>36  SEPTOPLASTY</strong>  [18] <br />
  Thackery plans to place a celluloid insert into Abigail’s nasal cavities to support her reconstructed nose. Abruptly, Abigail dies of an anesthetic reaction before the operation starts. <br />
  (Thackery and Chickering) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>37  INTESTINE RESECTION</strong>  [20] <br />
  Traumatized by Abigail’s sudden death of general anesthesia, Thackery insists on demonstrating a self-surgery and resecting his own necrotic intestine sections to promote spinal anesthesia. While continuing the procedure despite the unancipatedly complicated necrosis, Thackery accidentally cuts his abdominal aorta and loses his life in his own operating room.<br />
  (Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering) <br /><br /></p>
